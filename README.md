[Boomerang](http://www.boomerangapp.com) used email archives from over 20 different online communities to look at how different email sign-offs correlated with response rate. We wrote a blog post with our findings on [how to end an email](http://blog.boomerangapp.com/2017/01/how-to-end-an-email-email-sign-offs), and this repository's Jupyter Notebook is meant to give others a chance to see the study in more detail.

We used the[ BigBang toolkit](https://github.com/datactive/bigbang) to pull down thousands of emails and thread them, which served as a great way to quickly build a corpus of publicly-available emails.
